# Note: BusyBox init works just fine without an inittab. If no inittab is
# found, it has the following default behavior:
#	::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS
#	::askfirst:/bin/sh
#	::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/reboot
#	::shutdown:/sbin/swapoff -a
#	::shutdown:/bin/umount -a -r
#	::restart:/sbin/init
#	tty2::askfirst:/bin/sh
#	tty3::askfirst:/bin/sh
#	tty4::askfirst:/bin/sh
#
# Boot-time system configuration/initialization script.
# This is run first except when booting in single-user mode.
#
#::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS
::sysinit:/bin/mount -a

# /bin/sh invocations on selected ttys
#
# Note below that we prefix the shell commands with a "-" to indicate to the
# shell that it is supposed to be a login shell.  Normally this is handled by
# login, but since we are bypassing login in this case, BusyBox lets you do
# this yourself...
#
# Start an "askfirst" shell on the console (whatever that may be)
::askfirst:-/bin/sh
# Start an "askfirst" shell on /dev/tty2-4
#tty2::askfirst:-/bin/sh
#tty3::askfirst:-/bin/sh
#tty4::askfirst:-/bin/sh

# /bin/getty invocations for selected ttys
#tty4::respawn:/bin/getty 38400 tty5
#tty5::respawn:/bin/getty 38400 tty6

# Example of how to put a getty on a serial line (for a terminal)
::respawn:/bin/getty -L ttyS0 9600 vt100
#::respawn:/bin/getty -L ttyS1 9600 vt100
#
# Example how to put a getty on a modem line.
#::respawn:/bin/getty 57600 ttyS2

# Stuff to do when restarting the init process
::restart:/bin/init

# Stuff to do before rebooting
#::ctrlaltdel:/bin/reboot
::shutdown:/bin/umount -a -r
#::shutdown:/bin/swapoff -a
